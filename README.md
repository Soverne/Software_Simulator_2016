# Software Simulator 2016

You are an employee of Blufriz Corporation, assigned to work on their latest product: the Sambra 8 Spacial Screen, or S8C. Marketing teams have been working non-stop to generate hype for the release. Only problem: your department has barely done anything. Produce enough code for the S8C before the release date rolls around and without letting public anger boil over.

TO WIN:
Reach 150 Code before the deadline expires.

TO LOSE:
Have less than 150 Code when the deadline expires.
Let Anger reach 100%.
Let your Sanity reach 0%.

TO PLAY:
 - Click on the large button to produce Code.
 - Leaking information will decrease Anger but consume some of your already-produced Code.
 - You can push back the deadline at the cost of increasing Anger.
 - Pulling an all-nighter will give an instant boost to Code but consume much of your Sanity. Sanity replenishes slowly over time.
